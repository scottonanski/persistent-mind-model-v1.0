# Implementation Summary - October 2, 2025

## Overview

Completed two major features for PMM:
1. **Dual-Persona Conscience** - Eliminated false positive commitment extraction
2. **User Identity Tracking** - PMM now remembers user names across sessions

---

## Feature 1: Dual-Persona Conscience + Parser Fixes

### Problem
LLM-generated reflections contained meta-statements like "I will query the ledger" that were being misclassified as commitments, triggering hallucination warnings.

### Solution
Implemented architectural separation between analysis (Reflector) and action (User/Executor):

#### Changes Made
1. **Reflector Persona Tagging** (`pmm/runtime/loop.py`)
   - Tagged reflection events with `persona="reflector"`
   - Updated prompts to ban commitment language in reflections
   - Changed source from "emit_reflection" to "reflector"

2. **Extraction Skip Logic** (`pmm/runtime/loop.py`)
   - Skip commitment extraction from reflector-tagged events
   - Prevents meta-statements from being logged as commitments

3. **Enhanced Analysis Exemplars** (`pmm/commitments/extractor.py`)
   - Added 5 meta-statement exemplars
   - Better semantic training for reflector-style text

4. **Parser Bug Fixes** (`pmm/utils/parsers.py`)
   - Fixed plural "commitments" handling (no more "'s" fragments)
   - Skip table rows (lines with `|` or `→`)
   - Added length validation (>2 chars) for claims
   - Fixed `extract_closed_commitment_claims()` table handling

5. **Test Coverage** (`tests/test_parsers.py`)
   - Added 4 new parser tests
   - Total: 19/19 parser tests passing

### Results
- ✅ **145/145 tests passing** (126 commitment + 19 parser)
- ✅ **Zero hallucination warnings** in production testing
- ✅ **Zero false positives** from meta-statements, plurals, or tables
- ✅ **Backward compatible** - no ledger migration needed

### Files Modified
- `pmm/runtime/loop.py` - Reflector tagging + extraction skip
- `pmm/commitments/extractor.py` - Analysis exemplars
- `pmm/utils/parsers.py` - Plural + table handling
- `tests/test_parsers.py` - New tests

## Feature 2: User Identity Tracking

### Problem
PMM tracked assistant identity but not user identity. When user said "My name is Scott," PMM would forget it in the next session.

### Solution
Implemented user identity tracking with ledger persistence:

#### Changes Made
1. **Intent Classification** (`pmm/directives/classifier.py`)
   - Added `user_self_identification` intent
   - Detects patterns: "I'm [name]", "My name is [name]", "Call me [name]"
   - Returns confidence 0.9 for user self-identification

2. **Ledger Logging** (`pmm/runtime/loop.py`)
   - Logs `user_identity_set` event when user introduces themselves
   - Stores user_name in event metadata
   - Separate from assistant naming (no confusion)

3. **Context Injection** (`pmm/runtime/context_builder.py`)
   - Retrieves user name from most recent `user_identity_set` event
   - Injects "User: [name]" into system context
   - Available to LLM in all responses

4. **Test Coverage** (`tests/test_naming.py`)
   - Added 3 new tests for user identity
   - Total: 11/11 naming tests passing

### Results
- ✅ **User name persists across sessions**
- ✅ **Deterministic retrieval from ledger**
- ✅ **LLM has access to user identity**
- ✅ **11/11 naming tests passing**

### Example Flow
```
User: "My name is Scott"
  ↓
Classifier: user_self_identification, name="Scott", confidence=0.9
  ↓
Ledger: user_identity_set event logged
  ↓
Context: "User: Scott" injected
  ↓
Next session: PMM remembers "Scott"
```

### Files Modified
- `pmm/directives/classifier.py` - User self-identification detection
- `pmm/runtime/loop.py` - User identity logging
- `pmm/runtime/context_builder.py` - User name injection
- `tests/test_naming.py` - New tests

---

## Test Results

### Overall
- **156/156 total tests passing** ✅
  - 126 commitment tests
  - 19 parser tests  
  - 11 naming tests

### Specific Test Runs
```bash
# Commitment tests
pytest tests/ -k "commitment" -q
# 126 passed ✅

# Parser tests
pytest tests/test_parsers.py::TestExtractCommitmentClaims -v
# 19 passed ✅

# Naming tests
pytest tests/test_naming.py -v
# 11 passed ✅
```

## Production Validation

### Chat Session Testing
Ran extensive chat sessions with granite4 model:
- ✅ No hallucination warnings
- ✅ No false commitment extraction
- ✅ Tables and formatting handled correctly
- ✅ Meta-statements properly skipped
- ✅ User name remembered across sessions

### Database Evidence
```
Total Events: 850+
Commitment Events: 17
Reflection Events: 31
Reflector Persona Events: 7
User Identity Events: Multiple
```

## Key Insights

### Architectural
1. **Dual-Persona Pattern Works**
   - Separating analysis (Reflector) from action (User/Executor) eliminates semantic ambiguity
   - LLMs can't distinguish self-generated text from external input
   - Explicit tagging solves this at the architectural level

2. **Parser Edge Cases Matter**
   - Plural forms need special handling
   - Table formatting can trigger false positives
   - Length validation prevents fragment extraction

3. **Selective Persistence**
   - Not all LLM statements become persistent state
   - Only explicitly detected patterns (commitments, user identity) are logged
   - This is by design, not a bug

### Testing
1. **Comprehensive Coverage Essential**
   - Edge cases reveal systemic issues
   - Parser tests caught multiple bugs
   - Integration tests validate end-to-end flow

2. **Database Evidence Matters**
   - Hard evidence from ledger queries proves persistence
   - Event counts and metadata validate behavior
   - Deterministic replay ensures consistency
