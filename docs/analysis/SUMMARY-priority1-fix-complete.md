# Priority 1 Critical Fix: Complete

**Date**: 2025-10-02  
**Issue**: Reflection text being extracted as commitments  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED AND TESTED**

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented and tested the Priority 1 critical fix to prevent reflection text from polluting the commitment ledger. The fix adds two-layer filtering to `_extract_commitments_from_text()` in `pmm/runtime/loop.py`.

## What Was Fixed

### The Bug
Entire reflection responses (1000+ characters) were being extracted as commitments:
```
[3298] reflection (1895 chars)
  "Event ID 001, CID abcdef... IAS is already at maximum..."
  
[3300] commitment_open (same 1895 chars!)
  "Commitment opened: Event ID 001, CID abcdef..."
```

### The Solution
Added filtering logic that rejects commitment text if:
1. **Contains reflection markers** (IAS=, GAS=, Event ID, Stage S4, etc.)
2. **Exceeds length limit** (> 400 characters via `MAX_COMMITMENT_CHARS`)

## Changes Made

### Code Changes
- **File**: `pmm/runtime/loop.py`
- **Lines**: 1202-1229
- **Changes**: Added reflection marker detection and length validation
- **Impact**: Prevents reflection text from being extracted as commitments

### Test Coverage
- **New file**: `tests/test_commitment_reflection_filter.py`
- **Tests added**: 5 comprehensive tests
- **All tests pass**: ✅ 122/122 commitment-related tests

### Documentation
- **Analysis**: `docs/analysis/ledger-inspection-findings.md`
- **Fix details**: `docs/analysis/COMMIT-reflection-filter-fix.md`
- **This summary**: `docs/analysis/SUMMARY-priority1-fix-complete.md`

## Test Results

```bash
$ pytest tests/ -k "commitment" -v
==================== 122 passed, 563 deselected, 10 warnings in 2.32s =====================
```

All commitment-related tests pass, including:
- ✅ 8 existing commitment extractor tests
- ✅ 5 new reflection filter tests
- ✅ 109 other commitment-related tests

## Verification

### Before Fix (from ledger inspection)
```
Total commitment_open events: 63
Average length: ~800 characters
Currently open: 0
Problem: All commitments are long reflections
```

### After Fix (expected behavior)
```
Commitments ≤ 400 characters: ✅
No reflection markers: ✅
Only actionable statements: ✅
Commitment tracking functional: ✅
```

## Impact on Hallucination Issue

This fix addresses **1 of 3 root causes** identified in the ledger inspection:

| Issue | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Reflection text extraction** | ✅ **FIXED** | This commit |
| Missing source metadata | ⏳ TODO | Needs investigation |
| LLM fabrication | ⏳ TODO | Requires prompt engineering |

### Relationship to Hallucination Detector

The hallucination detector was **working correctly** - it was detecting that the LLM was referencing commitments that didn't exist. The problem was:

1. **Real commitments in ledger** = Long reflections (unactionable)
2. **LLM invents** = Simple commitments (Event 118: "Adjust threshold")
3. **Detector correctly flags** = Invented commitments don't match ledger

Now with this fix:
- Real commitments will be short and actionable
- LLM may still invent references (separate issue)
- But at least the ledger won't be polluted with reflections

## Compliance Checklist

✅ **Ledger integrity** - Prevents invalid commitment events  
✅ **Determinism** - Filtering is deterministic  
✅ **No regex** - Uses simple string matching  
✅ **Test coverage** - 5 new tests, all pass  
✅ **Minimal changes** - Focused fix, ~30 lines  
✅ **No breaking changes** - All existing tests pass  
✅ **Documentation** - Complete analysis and fix docs  

## Next Steps

### Priority 2: Missing Source Metadata
Investigate why all commitments show `source: unknown` instead of "user" or "assistant".

**Investigation needed**:
- Check if `source` parameter is being passed correctly
- Verify metadata merging in `tracker.add_commitment()`
- Look for silent exceptions that might be swallowing the source

### Priority 3: LLM Fabrication
Address the LLM inventing commitment references that don't exist.

**Potential solutions**:
1. Enhance prompts to discourage fabrication
2. Provide explicit ledger state in context
3. Add post-generation validation
4. Consider penalizing hallucinations in reflection scoring

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
```bash
git revert <this-commit>
rm tests/test_commitment_reflection_filter.py
```

Previous behavior will resume (with reflection pollution).

## Sign-off

- ✅ **Implementation**: Complete
- ✅ **Testing**: 122/122 tests pass
- ✅ **Documentation**: Complete
- ✅ **Code review**: Ready
- ✅ **Deployment**: Safe to merge

**Ready for Priority 2 investigation.**
