## 📖 Key Concepts

**PMM** (Persistent Mind Model) turns stateless chatbots into **persistent, data-driven AI agents** that remember past interactions and adapt deterministically:
- **🧠 Structured Reflection**: Background analysis loops tuned to clear, inspectable rules
- **🌱 Trait Evolution**: Personality weights that adjust from event evidence
- **🎯 Goal Tracking**: Commitments discovered, monitored, and resolved through the ledger
- **🔍 Full Transparency**: Every state change recorded in an append-only, hash-chained log

PMM is model-agnostic by design. Today it ships adapters for OpenAI and local Ollama models, and the runtime surface lets you add new providers by implementing a lightweight LLM adapter and pointing the environment variables at it.
