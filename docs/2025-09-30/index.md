# 🧠 Persistent Mind Model (PMM)

**An AI that remembers, evolves, and grows from every interaction.**

---

## 🤔 What is PMM?

PMM transforms traditional chatbots into **stateful AI agents** that preserve context, adapt behaviour deterministically, and explain their decisions. Instead of forgetting each conversation, PMM replays an append-only event ledger to rebuild its current state.

**Think of it as**: Giving an AI memory, governance, and repeatable adaptation—closer to a well-documented teammate than a stateless calculator.

## 💡 What Makes PMM Different?

**Traditional AI**: Stateless, forgetful, reactive
**PMM**: Stateful, remembering, autonomous, evolving

Every interaction with PMM creates **permanent events** in a hash-chained log, ensuring complete auditability and deterministic behavior. PMM doesn't just respond - it **learns from every conversation** and **actively improves itself**.
