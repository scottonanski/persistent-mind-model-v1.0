# Archived GPT-5.1 Proof Files

This folder contains the original GPT-5.1 proof artifacts:

- `GPT-5.1-chat-proof.md`
- `GPT-5.1-ledger.json`
- `GPT-5.1-telemetry.md`

They were early placeholders. The Gemma‑3‑4B logs for the original Echo run live here as archived evidence (`gemma3-4b-*.{md,json}`), but the current canonical proof run for the docs uses the Granite‑4 exports in `docs/granite-4-*.{md,json,md}`.
