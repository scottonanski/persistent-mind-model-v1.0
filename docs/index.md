# 🧠 Persistent Mind Model (PMM)

**An AI that remembers, evolves, and grows from every interaction.**

---

## 🤔 What is PMM?

PMM transforms traditional chatbots into **living AI minds** that maintain continuous memory, develop personality over time, and autonomously improve their behavior. Unlike AI that forgets every conversation, PMM builds a persistent identity through event-driven evolution.

**Think of it as**: Giving an AI a "mind" that grows and learns from experience, rather than a stateless calculator that starts fresh each time.

## 💡 What Makes PMM Different?

**Traditional AI**: Stateless, forgetful, reactive
**PMM**: Stateful, remembering, autonomous, evolving

Every interaction with PMM creates **permanent events** in a hash-chained log, ensuring complete auditability and deterministic behavior. PMM doesn't just respond - it **learns from every conversation** and **actively improves itself**.
