"""Tests for commitment extraction filtering to prevent reflection text pollution.

This test suite verifies that the _extract_commitments_from_text method
correctly filters out:
1. Long reflection-like text (> MAX_COMMITMENT_CHARS)
2. Text containing reflection markers (IAS, GAS, Event ID, etc.)
3. Analytical/system status text that shouldn't be commitments

Background:
During testing with granite4:latest, we discovered that entire reflection
responses (1000+ chars) were being extracted as commitments, polluting the
commitment ledger. This test ensures the filtering logic prevents that.
