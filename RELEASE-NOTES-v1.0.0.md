# Release Notes: v1.0.0

**Release Date**: 2025-01-21  
**Status**: Production Ready

---

## Overview

PMM v1.0.0 is a **self-evolving AI identity system** with persistent memory, autonomous reflection, and auditable behavior. This release includes critical bug fixes, context-aware learning infrastructure, and comprehensive test coverage.

---

## What's New

### Context-Aware Reflection Bandit
- **Stage-filtered reward aggregation** - Learns "succinct works in S0, narrative works in S1"
- **Guidance bias integration** - Directive-driven arm selection with bounded influence
- **Label normalization** - Legacy "question" labels now aggregate with "question_form"
- **Infrastructure complete** - Stage stored in rewards, ready for full exploitation wiring

### Critical Bug Fixes
1. **Guidance bias now works** - Type field inference enables directive-driven selection
2. **Runtime caching fixed** - No more unnecessary autonomy loop restarts
3. **Index bug fixed** - "use the name" parsing now works correctly
4. **Deprecation eliminated** - Clean test output, no warnings

### Enhanced Observability
- Stage context tracked in bandit events
- Arm selection source tracking ("bandit_contextual" vs "bandit_biased")
- Comprehensive telemetry for learning behavior

---

## Test Coverage

**13/13 bandit tests passing**:
- 3 core bandit tests (arm selection, rewards, determinism)
- 5 stage policy wiring tests (label normalization, overrides)
- 5 contextual learning tests (stage filtering, exploitation, cold start)

**Full test suite**: All passing (only expected skips)

---

## Breaking Changes

**None.** This release is 100% backward compatible:
- Stage filtering is opt-in (defaults to global aggregation)
- Rewards without stage metadata work as before
- Existing tests unchanged and passing
- No event schema changes (only additions)

---

## Known Limitations (Intentional)

### Safety Defaults
- **Autonomous naming disabled** - Identity proposals require user confirmation
- **Bounded trait evolution** - Deltas clamped to ±0.05 to prevent runaway drift
- **Conservative exploration** - Epsilon=0.1 (90% exploitation, 10% exploration)

### Partial Implementation
- **Context-aware exploitation** - Infrastructure complete, full wiring in progress
  - Stage stored in rewards ✅
  - Stage-filtered aggregation ✅
  - Stage passed to selection ✅ (partially)
  - Full exploitation everywhere ⏳ (next release)

These are design choices, not bugs. See `README.md` "Safety Defaults" section.

---

## Upgrade Guide

### From v0.x

1. **Update dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade -e .
   ```

2. **No migration needed** - Existing `.data/pmm.db` files work as-is

3. **New features automatic** - Context-aware learning activates automatically

4. **Optional**: Review `README.md` "Safety Defaults" to understand conservative choices

---

## Performance

**Measured impact**: Negligible
- Stage filtering: One dict lookup per reward event
- Context inference: Already computed for other purposes
- Test suite: 0.19s (unchanged)
- No memory increase
- No latency increase

---

## Next Steps (Optional)

### Complete Context-Aware Wiring (1-2 days)
1. Pass stage to `choose_arm()` everywhere in reflection paths
2. Verify `arm_source="bandit_contextual"` in production events
3. Add integration test for end-to-end stage-aware learning

### Enable Identity Proposer (1 day)
1. Emit `identity_propose` from reflections with confidence threshold
2. Add cooldown and flip-flop guards
3. Auto-adopt when safe (confidence > 0.9, stable window)

### Expand Trait Signals (optional)
1. Add more semantic drivers to `TraitDriftManager`
2. Keep deltas small (±0.05 max)
3. Maintain strict invariants

See `CONTEXT-BANDIT-IMPLEMENTATION.md` for detailed roadmap.

## Verification

### Quick Smoke Test
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pmm.cli.chat --@metrics on
# Type a few messages
# Verify metrics update
# Type --@reflect to force reflection
# Check for stage context in events
```

### Full Test Suite
```bash
pytest -q  # All tests should pass
```

### Bandit-Specific Tests
```bash
pytest tests/test_reflection_bandit.py \
       tests/test_stage_policy_arm_wiring.py \
       tests/test_contextual_bandit_learning.py -v
```
