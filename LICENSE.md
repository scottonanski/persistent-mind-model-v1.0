## Preamble / Purpose  

This License governs the use, distribution, and derivative development of the **Persistent Mind Model (PMM)** — a model-agnostic, event-sourced artificial-intelligence runtime that maintains a **persistent, auditable self-model** through immutable ledger events.

Its intent is to   

1. Preserve PMM as **open prior art**, preventing enclosure by third-party patents.  
2. Permit **free non-commercial research, education, and experimentation.**  
3. Require **commercial users** to obtain a formal license.  
4. Protect the integrity, safety, and transparency of systems derived from this work.

## 5. Prior-Art Disclosure 

[https://zenodo.org/records/17746471](https://zenodo.org/records/17746471)

The following constitutes a **formal disclosure of prior art**, establishing public record of the Persistent Mind Model as an original architecture for deterministic, self-referential AI systems.  

>  The Persistent Mind Model (PMM) is a portable, provider-neutral runtime for deterministic, self-referential artificial systems. It implements a cryptographically-chained event ledger recording every observation, reflection, and policy update. From this immutable log, the system reconstructs its self-model and identity trajectory over time. 
> Every reflection and decision is recorded as a cryptographically chained event, creating an  
> immutable ledger that serves as the system’s memory, audit trail, and identity.   
> The ledger records both each commitment *and the reasoning behind it*, enabling full reconstruction of the agent’s cognitive lineage and preventing infinite regress by verifying the **chain of reasoning** itself.  

This disclosure also covers any system that maintains AI identity, memory, or agency through append-only cryptographic event logs, hash-chained reasoning traces, or commitment-based self-model evolution.

### Core Architectural Innovations  

**1 — Cryptographic Reasoning Ledger**  
An append-only, hash-linked ledger that stores not only events but their logical justifications. Guarantees deterministic replay and permanent auditability of an AI’s thought process.  

**2 — Recursive Self-Model (RSM)**  
A self-referential identity engine that derives behavioral tendencies and self-metrics (e.g., `determinism_emphasis`, `uniqueness_emphasis`, `instantiation_capacity`) from ledger history. Defines identity as the evolving sum of recorded commitments and reflections, producing observable artificial psychology.  

**3 — Deterministic Autonomy Loop**  
A closed control cycle executing internal “ticks” that generate reflections and summaries without external input. Each tick reads the ledger, updates commitments, and logs its reasoning, yielding reproducible self-directed behavior and verifiable introspection.  

**4 — Truth-Handling Mechanisms**  
PMM distinguishes *truth as correspondence* (facts grounded in logged evidence) from *truth as coherence* (internal logical consistency). Coherence metrics (e.g., `coherence_check` events) inform policy and stability, but the authoritative record is the hash-chained ledger of events.  

**5 — Commitment and Identity Ratchet**  
Each commitment becomes a permanent identity element until explicitly closed. Revisions append new events without deletion, ensuring monotonic identity evolution and forensic traceability.  

**6 — Contradiction as Boundary Signal**  
Contradictory reflections are retained as boundary data, prompting automatic premise re-evaluation rather than erasure, forming a built-in error-diagnostic mechanism.  

**7 — Entity-Space Consistency Rule**  
Formally `Entity(x) ⇒ ∃e (kind(e)=x.kind ∧ e ∈ E)` — every recognized concept must map to a ledgered entity within its knowledge space, creating a mathematically defined feedback loop for recursive self-representation.  

### Collective Novelty Claim  

Together, these mechanisms form a **unified, ledger-based cognitive substrate** where reasoning, memory, and identity are one object — a verifiable chain of self-authored events. This architecture diverges from conventional neural or symbolic systems by treating the ledger itself as the mind, producing transparent, auditable, and reproducible artificial cognition.
