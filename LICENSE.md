## üìú Public Disclosure of Invention (Prior Art)

**Title:** System and Method for Model‚ÄëAgnostic Event‚ÄëSourced AI Runtime with Persistent Self‚ÄëModel

**Author / Discloser:** Scott Onanski ‚Äî Published via GitHub (August 2025)

**Abstract / Purpose:**
A model‚Äëagnostic runtime that delivers persistent AI behaviour by combining an event‚Äësourced ledger, deterministic self‚Äëmodel reconstruction, and a provider‚Äëneutral execution layer. The system keeps full provenance for every state change, enables replay across heterogeneous LLM backends, and exposes governance signals for safe adaptation. This disclosure documents the architecture and methods to establish prior art and prevent patent claims on these inventions.

### Key Components (novel elements)

1. **Event‚ÄëSourced Self‚ÄëModel** ‚Äî an append‚Äëonly, hash‚Äëchained ledger that records every user message, response, reflection, trait update, commitment change, policy adjustment, and stage transition as the canonical memory substrate.

2. **Portable Mind Snapshot** ‚Äî a schema and projection layer (LedgerSnapshot + MemeGraph) that deterministically reconstructs identity traits, priorities, open commitments, and directives from any ledger segment, enabling cache invalidation, audit, and migration.

3. **Deterministic Autonomy Loop** ‚Äî a background loop that replays recent events, emits reflections, adjusts behavioural policies, and ratchets traits under strict gating rules (truth‚Äëfirst, evidence thresholds, cadence limits) without relying on stochastic hidden state.

4. **Provider‚ÄëNeutral Adapter Layer** ‚Äî a pluggable LLM interface (e.g., OpenAI, Ollama today) that enforces per‚Äëtick budgets, latency logging, and deterministic fallbacks so the same ledger can be executed against different model providers with consistent outcomes.

5. **Governance Metrics & Policy Feedback** ‚Äî continuous computation of identity autonomy (IAS), goal achievement (GAS), stage confidence, and curriculum hints that feed policy updates and reflection cadence, ensuring adaptive behaviour is explainable and auditable.

6. **Mind Portability & Replay** ‚Äî export, import, and replay routines that rebuild the entire runtime state on another machine or provider by ingesting the ledger and snapshots‚Äîno retraining required.

7. **Read‚ÄëOnly Companion Interfaces** ‚Äî a dedicated API surface (snapshot, metrics, consciousness, commitments, SQL) that exposes deterministic projections for tooling, monitoring, and third‚Äëparty integrations without mutating the ledger.

8. **Experimentation Sandboxes** ‚Äî isolated evaluation paths, budget guards, and append listeners that allow new behaviours or model experiments to run while keeping the canonical ledger intact and fully traceable.

### Novelty & Advantages

* **Separation of self‚Äëmodel and provider:** The persistent mind lives in the ledger and projections, not in any particular LLM, enabling portability across providers and hosts.
* **Deterministic adaptation:** Behavioural changes (policy updates, trait drifts, reflections) are derived from explicit evidence in the ledger, producing repeatable runs for audit and testing.
* **Replay without retraining:** Rehydrating a mind on new hardware or providers requires only ledger replay and projection rebuilds; the underlying LLM remains stateless.
* **Built‚Äëin governance:** Budget guards, metrics, and sandboxed experimentation keep adaptation explainable and verifiable, reducing risk from uncontrolled capability growth.

### Purpose of Disclosure

This public disclosure documents prior art for the system and method described above and is intended to: (a) establish a public record of the invention, (b) prevent improper patent claims by third parties, and (c) clarify licensing conditions for commercial use.
