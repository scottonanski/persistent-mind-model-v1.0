## Preamble / Purpose

This License governs the use, distribution, and derivative development of the **Persistent Mind Model (PMM)** — a model-agnostic, event-sourced artificial intelligence runtime that maintains a persistent self-model through immutable ledger events.

Its intent is to:

1. Preserve PMM as **open prior art**, preventing enclosure by third-party patents.  
2. Permit **free non-commercial research, education, and experimentation**.  
3. Require **commercial users** to obtain a formal license.  
4. Protect the integrity, safety, and transparency of systems derived from this work.

## 1. Definitions

**“PMM”** — the Persistent Mind Model architecture, source code, database schema, and derivative systems including event-sourced ledgers, reflection loops, and trait-based autonomy mechanisms.  
**“Derivative Work”** — any modification, extension, or system implementing or inspired by PMM principles.  
**“Non-Commercial Use”** — personal, academic, or research use that does not directly generate revenue or provide commercial advantage.  
**“Commercial Use”** — any integration, deployment, or service incorporating PMM or its derivatives for profit, compensation, or organizational benefit.  
**“Licensee”** — any individual or organization exercising rights under this License.

---

## 2. Non-Commercial License

Subject to compliance with this License, the Licensor grants the Licensee a **worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, revocable right** to:

- Use and modify PMM for **research, education, testing, or personal study**.  
- Publish analyses, papers, or derivative prototypes referencing PMM architecture.  
- Redistribute unmodified copies of PMM source under this same License.

### Conditions

- Attribution must appear clearly in source and documentation:

  > “Based on the Persistent Mind Model © 2025 Scott O’Nanski.”

- Derivative Works must include this License in full.  
- Non-Commercial Use may **not** include integration into paid products, hosted services, or corporate systems without separate commercial permission.

---

## 3. Commercial License

Any Commercial Use requires a **signed commercial agreement** with the Licensor.

Such agreement may include:

- A one-time or recurring fee,  
- Attribution and co-branding terms,  
- Source-integrity and audit provisions,  
- Compliance with safety and transparency obligations.

Commercial rights are **not implied** by possession or publication of source code.  
Unauthorized commercial deployment constitutes copyright infringement.

## 4. Attribution & Redistribution

- All redistributions of PMM or Derivative Works must retain this License, author credit, and version number.  
- Public presentations, publications, or academic references shall cite the PMM as:

  > O’Nanski, S. (2025). *Persistent Mind Model v1.1 — A Model-Agnostic Event-Sourced AI Runtime.*

- Removal of attribution, obfuscation of provenance, or false claims of authorship are expressly prohibited.

## 5. Prior-Art Disclosure

The following constitutes a **formal disclosure of prior art**, establishing public record of PMM’s novel system design and intellectual independence:

> The Persistent Mind Model (PMM) is a portable, provider-neutral runtime for deterministic, self-referential artificial systems.  
> It implements a **cryptographically-chained event ledger** recording every observation, reflection, and policy update.  
> From this immutable log, the system reconstructs its **self-model** and **identity trajectory** over time.

### Core Architectural Components

- **Event-Sourced Ledger** — immutable chronological store of thoughts, actions, and reflections.  
- **Portable Mind Snapshots** — serialized representations of model state for replay or migration.  
- **Deterministic Autonomy Loop** — governs reflection, commitment, and evolution with reproducible outcomes.  
- **Provider-Neutral Adapter Layer** — enables runtime independence from any single AI provider.  
- **Governance Metrics (IAS/GAS)** — quantitative measures of alignment and self-consistency.  
- **LedgerMirror Subsystem** — permits read-only introspection and verification of historical state.  
- **Experimentation Sandboxes** — isolated environments for behavioral testing under harm constraints.

Together, these mechanisms constitute a verifiable framework for **persistent, auditable self-modelling** in artificial systems.

## 6. Limitations & Warranty Disclaimer

PMM is provided **“as is”** without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.  
The Licensor shall not be liable for any claim, damages, or liability arising from use or inability to use PMM, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise.

Licensee assumes full responsibility for compliance with **ethical, legal, and safety standards** in any derivative deployment.

---

## 7. Acceptance & Jurisdiction

Use of PMM in any form constitutes acceptance of this License.  
All disputes shall be governed by the laws of **British Columbia, Canada**, under exclusive jurisdiction of its courts.  
The Licensor reserves the right to amend this License for future versions; existing Licensees retain rights under the version accepted at time of acquisition.
