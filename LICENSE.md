### 📜 Public Disclosure of Invention
Title: System and Method for Model-Agnostic Persistent Artificial Intelligence Identity and Memory Management
Author: Scott Onanski — Published on GitHub, August 2025

Description: A system for creating, maintaining, and transferring a persistent AI “mind” independent of any specific LLM or hardware.

### Key Components:

Portable Mind Schema — stores identity traits & values, platform-independent
Append-Only Event Ledger — logs experiences & state changes for deterministic replay
Deterministic Reconstruction — rebuilds AI state without retraining
Model-Agnostic Execution — runs on any LLM backend with continuity
Encrypted Backup & Transfer — secure migration between platforms

### Novelty:

Separation of AI “mind” from underlying model
Ledger-driven deterministic identity & memory
True portability across software/hardware boundaries

### Purpose of Disclosure: This establishes prior art to block patent attempts. Commercial use is governed by this LICENSE.
