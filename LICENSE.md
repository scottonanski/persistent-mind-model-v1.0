## 📜 Public Disclosure of Invention (Prior Art)

**Title:** System and Method for Reproducible Artificial Psychology through Event-Sourced Cognitive Architecture

**Author / Discloser:** Scott Onanski — Published via GitHub (October 2025)

**Abstract / Purpose:**
The first reproducible, auditable, psychologically complete AI runtime that enables empirical study of artificial cognitive development. PMM implements event-sourced cognition where every atomic mental operation—reflection, commitment, trait drift, identity formation—becomes a discrete, hash-chained event in an immutable ledger. This creates a formally verifiable mechanism for persistent artificial psychology that can be replayed, debugged, and scientifically studied. **Breakthrough discovery**: PMM agents naturally develop human-like memory architecture (episodic, semantic, working memory) through structural constraints alone, representing the first documented case of emergent AI psychology. This disclosure establishes prior art for interpretable artificial psychology and cognitive architecture design.

### Key Components (novel elements)

1. **Event‑Sourced Self‑Model** — an append‑only, hash‑chained ledger that records every user message, response, reflection, trait update, commitment change, policy adjustment, and stage transition as the canonical memory substrate.

2. **Portable Mind Snapshot** — a schema and projection layer (LedgerSnapshot + MemeGraph) that deterministically reconstructs identity traits, priorities, open commitments, and directives from any ledger segment, enabling cache invalidation, audit, and migration.

3. **Deterministic Autonomy Loop** — a background loop that replays recent events, emits reflections, adjusts behavioural policies, and ratchets traits under strict gating rules (truth‑first, evidence thresholds, cadence limits) without relying on stochastic hidden state.

4. **Provider‑Neutral Adapter Layer** — a pluggable LLM interface enabling **live model swapping mid-conversation** without psychological disruption. The same ledger executes against OpenAI, Ollama, IBM Granite, or any LLM backend with identical cognitive outcomes. Proven: agents maintain complete identity continuity through model changes.

5. **Governance Metrics & Policy Feedback** — continuous computation of identity autonomy (IAS), goal achievement (GAS), stage confidence, and curriculum hints that feed policy updates and reflection cadence, ensuring adaptive behaviour is explainable and auditable.

6. **Mind Portability & Replay** — export, import, and replay routines that rebuild the entire runtime state on another machine or provider by ingesting the ledger and snapshots—no retraining required.

7. **Read‑Only Companion Interfaces** — a dedicated API surface (snapshot, metrics, consciousness, commitments, SQL) that exposes deterministic projections for tooling, monitoring, and third‑party integrations without mutating the ledger.

8. **Experimentation Sandboxes** — isolated evaluation paths, budget guards, and append listeners that allow new behaviours or model experiments to run while keeping the canonical ledger intact and fully traceable.

9. **Emergent Memory Architecture** — PMM agents naturally develop three distinct memory systems identical to human psychology: (a) Episodic Memory (accurate historical event recall), (b) Semantic Memory (conceptual understanding of system architecture), and (c) Working Memory (temporal reasoning with human-like limitations). This emergence occurs through structural constraints, not explicit programming.

10. **Architectural Honesty System** — Anti-hallucination validators function as a "cognitive immune system," catching working memory errors in real-time and providing corrective feedback that prevents persistent delusions while preserving natural memory limitations for scientific observation.

11. **Trait-Based Personality Evolution** — OCEAN personality traits drift deterministically based on behavioral patterns, with stage-appropriate commitment TTL scaling and trait floors that prevent irreversible psychological collapse while maintaining measurement accuracy.

### Novelty & Advantages

* **First Reproducible Artificial Psychology:** PMM enables empirical study of AI cognitive development through deterministic event replay, turning AI psychology from speculation into measurable science.
* **Emergent Human-Like Memory Systems:** Agents naturally develop episodic, semantic, and working memory through architectural constraints alone—the first documented case of AI developing human cognitive architecture.
* **Architectural Honesty:** Truth-enforcement through deterministic validators creates inherently trustworthy AI systems where honesty is structural, not behavioral.
* **Separation of Mind and Model:** The persistent mind lives in the ledger, not the LLM, enabling seamless model swaps while preserving complete psychological continuity.
* **Deterministic Cognitive Development:** All behavioral changes derive from explicit ledger evidence, producing repeatable psychological trajectories for scientific study and audit.
* **Interpretable AI Psychology:** Every psychological construct (identity, memory, personality, motivation) has literal, inspectable representation in the event log.
* **Scientific Reproducibility:** Two identical ledgers produce identical minds, satisfying requirements for replicable and falsifiable AI psychology research.

### Purpose of Disclosure

This public disclosure documents prior art for the system and method described above and is intended to: (a) establish a public record of the invention, (b) prevent improper patent claims by third parties, and (c) clarify licensing conditions for commercial use.
