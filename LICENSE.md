## Preface

This document is the full license and prior-art disclosure for the Persistent Mind Model (PMM) project. It covers the repository‚Äôs source code, CLI, scripts, documentation, and tests, and sets out the dual-license terms (Non-Commercial / Commercial) under which PMM is released. The Prior Art / Public Disclosure section describes the novel inventions and system architecture to establish prior art.

## üìú Public Disclosure of Invention (Prior Art)

**Title:** System and Method for Model‚ÄëAgnostic Persistent Artificial Intelligence Identity and Memory Management

**Author / Discloser:** Scott Onanski ‚Äî Published via GitHub (August 2025)

**Abstract / Purpose:**
A platform‚Äëagnostic system that enables persistence of an AI "mind" across model backends and runs via an append‚Äëonly ledger, deterministic reconstruction, and a portable mind schema. The disclosure documents the architecture, core components, and methods to establish prior art and prevent patent claims on the described inventions.

### Key Components (novel elements)

1. **Portable Mind Schema** ‚Äî a platform‚Äëindependent serializable schema that stores identity traits, commitments, priorities, and state values allowing an AI "mind" to be reconstructed deterministically on different LLM backends.

2. **Append‚ÄëOnly Event Ledger** ‚Äî deterministic, tamper‚Äëevident log of events, commitments, reflections, trait adjustments, and policy updates that serves as canonical memory for the persistent mind.

3. **Deterministic Reconstruction Engine** ‚Äî a deterministic replay mechanism that rebuilds an AI‚Äôs internal state from ledger events without retraining the underlying LLM, enabling reproducible identity transfer between models and hosts.

4. **Model‚ÄëAgnostic Execution Layer** ‚Äî an abstraction that decouples procedural identity and decision logic from any single LLM; the same mind schema and ledger can be executed on multiple LLM backends (local or remote) with consistent behavior.

5. **Reflection & Commitment Cycle** ‚Äî a built‚Äëin loop where the system records commitments, revisits them, updates traits (e.g., OCEAN‚Äëstyle), and ratchets capability while enforcing gating checks (truth‚Äëfirst, safety constraints, reproducibility checks).

6. **Encrypted Backup & Transfer Mechanism** ‚Äî secure export/import of the portable mind schema plus event ledger enabling migration of a persistent mind across machines and clouds while preserving cryptographic integrity and confidentiality.

7. **Metricization & Governance Signals** ‚Äî continuous metrics (e.g., IAS, GAS) derived from ledger activity to guide policy updates, reflection cadence, and identity adoption heuristics.

8. **Sandboxed Measurement & Tracing** ‚Äî execution sandboxes and tracers for candidate evaluations, ensuring experimental changes are measured and validated without leaking state or causing irreversible changes to the canonical ledger.

### Novelty & Advantages

* **Separation of mind and model:** The architecture isolates the persistent identity from any single model instance, enabling porting, long‚Äëterm continuity, and deterministic replay.
* **Ledger‚Äëdriven identity:** Identity and commitments are captured as first‚Äëclass artifacts in an append‚Äëonly ledger, enabling provenance, audit, and deterministic reconstruction.
* **Reproducible transfer without retraining:** The deterministic reconstruction engine allows restarting or migrating a mind without re‚Äëtraining, merely by replaying ledger events into a compatible schema and execution layer.
* **Safety & evaluation gates:** Integrated gates and sandboxing for candidate improvements prevent unchecked capability escalations and prioritize truth and safety.

### Purpose of Disclosure

This public disclosure documents prior art for the system and method described above and is intended to: (a) establish a public record of the invention, (b) prevent improper patent claims by third parties, and (c) clarify licensing conditions for commercial use.
