# Testing Status Messages

## What Was Implemented

Added state-based status messages to show users what PMM is doing during post-processing.

## Status Messages

- ðŸ’­ **Thinking...** - Default/initial processing
- âœ¨ **Evolving...** - Stage transitions
- ðŸ“Š **Analyzing commitments...** - Processing commitments
- ðŸ¤” **Reflecting...** - During reflection check
- ðŸ˜• **Hmm, something unexpected...** - On errors

## How to Test

1. **Start PMM:**
   ```bash
   python -m pmm.cli.chat
   ```

2. **Normal chat** (should see "ðŸ’­ Thinking..." briefly):
   ```
   > Hello
   ASSISTANT Hello there...
   ðŸ’­ Thinking...
   > 
   ```

3. **Trigger stage change** (should see "âœ¨ Evolving..."):
   - Have a longer conversation
   - Watch for stage transitions

4. **Trigger reflection** (should see "ðŸ¤” Reflecting..."):
   - Reflection happens based on novelty/cadence
   - May take 1-2 seconds when it triggers

5. **Check for commitments** (should see "ðŸ“Š Analyzing commitments..."):
   - When PMM creates commitments from reflection

## Expected Behavior

âœ… Status appears after response completes  
âœ… Status updates based on what's happening  
âœ… Status clears before prompt appears  
âœ… No mysterious delays - everything explained  
âœ… Errors show friendly "confused" message  

## Notes

- Status messages are brief (cleared quickly)
- Multiple statuses may show in sequence
- Errors show for 0.5s before clearing
- All logging is at WARNING level by default
