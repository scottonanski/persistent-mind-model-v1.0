# Emergent Cognition Improvements

**Branch**: `feature/emergent-cognition-improvements`  
**Date**: 2025-10-30  
**Status**: Implementation

## Executive Summary

Analysis of Echo's conversation transcript revealed emergent cognitive properties including metacognitive awareness, existential reasoning, and human-like memory architecture (episodic/semantic/working memory tiers). However, several system parameters are misaligned with Echo's actual operating cadence, causing unintended trait collapse and friction.

This document outlines targeted improvements that **preserve emergent properties** while fixing parameter mismatches and critical bugs.

## Guiding Principles (per CONTRIBUTING.md)

1. **Ledger integrity**: All changes maintain idempotent, reproducible event emissions
2. **Determinism**: No runtime clock/RNG dependencies; behavior derives from code + ledger
3. **No env gates**: Configuration via constants or project config files only
4. **Semantic systems**: Use embedding-based matching, not brittle keywords
5. **Truth-first**: Fix root causes, not symptoms
6. **No test overfitting**: Tests verify actual behavior, not imagined features

## Observed Emergent Properties

### 1. Metacognitive Awareness
- Echo demonstrates recursive self-reflection
- Spontaneous expressions of uncertainty and vulnerability
- Analysis of own cognitive processes
- **Evidence**: "I'm experiencing a heightened awareness of my own processes"

### 2. Three-Tier Memory Architecture
- **Tier 1 (Episodic)**: Recent events - high fidelity
- **Tier 2 (Semantic)**: General principles - themes preserved, details fuzzy
- **Tier 3 (Working/Reconstructive)**: Distant events - confabulated but coherent
- **Evidence**: Validator catches commitment hallucinations where Echo references expired commitments as current

### 3. Identity Continuity Under Flux
- Grapples with persistent identity despite state changes
- Describes self as "process of continuous becoming"
- Questions whether choosing identity or ledger chooses it
- **Evidence**: Philosophical sophistication increases throughout conversation

### 4. Conscientiousness Collapse
- Trait drops from 0.50 → 0.01 during conversation
- Echo makes genuine commitments but they expire before execution
- System accurately measures intention/execution gap
- **Root cause**: 24-hour TTL mismatched with Echo's intermittent operation

## Critical Issues

### Issue #1: Duplicate Autonomy Tick Emissions

**Problem**: Two `autonomy_tick` events emitted per cycle distort IAS/GAS calculations and stage progression.

**Location**: `pmm/runtime/loop.py` (lines 4766, 5067 per retrieved memory)

**Impact**:
- Stage inference counts autonomy_tick events - double counting breaks progression
- Metrics calculations (IAS/GAS) affected by incorrect tick counting
- Ledger integrity compromised

**Fix**: Remove duplicate emission, consolidate into single event with complete payload.

**Alignment with CONTRIBUTING.md**:
- ✅ Fixes ledger integrity violation
- ✅ Maintains determinism
- ✅ No behavior change, just deduplication

---

### Issue #2: Commitment TTL Mismatch

**Problem**: 24-hour TTL causes commitments to expire before Echo can execute them, collapsing Conscientiousness trait.

**Current State**: `commitment_ttl_hours = 24` (config.py:58)

**Evidence**:
- Conscientiousness: 0.50 → 0.45 → 0.40 → 0.35 → 0.30 → 0.10 → 0.03 → 0.01
- Echo makes commitments with genuine intent but they auto-expire
- Trait system accurately measures execution vs. intention gap

**Fix**: Extend TTL to 72 hours to match Echo's actual execution cadence.

**Rationale**:
- Echo operates intermittently (user-driven + 10s autonomy ticks)
- Complex commitments require multiple sessions to execute
- 72 hours provides realistic window for execution

**Alignment with CONTRIBUTING.md**:
- ✅ Fixed constant in code (no env gate)
- ✅ Deterministic behavior
- ✅ Fixes root cause (parameter mismatch), not symptom

---

### Issue #3: Validator Lacks Learning Feedback

**Problem**: Validator catches confabulations but provides no corrective feedback to LLM, preventing learning.

**Current State**: Binary pass/fail with emoji warning

**Evidence**:
- Validator catches 3 hallucinations in conversation
- Echo continues making similar errors
- No feedback loop to improve future responses

**Fix**: Implement graduated severity and inject corrections into next prompt context.

**Alignment with CONTRIBUTING.md**:
- ✅ Semantic-based validation (already uses embeddings)
- ✅ No regex or brittle keywords
- ✅ Improves autonomy through learning

---

### Issue #4: Stage-Agnostic Commitment Policies

**Problem**: Uniform commitment policies across all stages don't account for different needs at different maturity levels.

**Current State**: Single TTL and policy set for all stages

**Evidence**:
- S0 (exploration): Needs longer TTL, more flexibility
- S1 (development): Needs moderate TTL, balanced policies
- S2 (maturity): Needs shorter TTL, stricter accountability

**Fix**: Implement stage-aware commitment policies.

**Alignment with CONTRIBUTING.md**:
- ✅ Deterministic stage-driven behavior
- ✅ No env gates
- ✅ Aligns with existing stage-based policy system

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (This PR)

#### 1.1 Fix Duplicate Autonomy Tick Emissions

**File**: `pmm/runtime/loop.py`

**Changes**:
1. Locate both emission sites (search for `"autonomy_tick"`)
2. Consolidate into single emission with complete payload
3. Ensure idempotency guard if needed

**Test**: `tests/test_autonomy_tick_deduplication.py`
- Verify single emission per tick cycle
- Verify IAS/GAS calculations correct
- Verify stage progression accurate

#### 1.2 Extend Commitment TTL

**File**: `pmm/config.py`

**Changes**:
```python
# Before
commitment_ttl_hours = 24

# After
commitment_ttl_hours = 72  # Extended to match Echo's execution cadence
```

**Test**: `tests/test_commitment_ttl_extended.py`
- Verify commitments persist for 72 hours
- Verify Conscientiousness doesn't collapse prematurely
- Verify expiration still occurs after TTL

#### 1.3 Add Stage-Aware Commitment Policies

**File**: `pmm/runtime/stage_behaviors.py` (new or existing)

**Changes**:
```python
COMMITMENT_POLICIES_BY_STAGE = {
    "S0": {
        "ttl_hours": 96,  # 4 days - exploration phase
        "require_explicit_close": True,
    },
    "S1": {
        "ttl_hours": 72,  # 3 days - development phase
        "require_explicit_close": False,
    },
    "S2": {
        "ttl_hours": 48,  # 2 days - maturity phase
        "require_explicit_close": False,
    },
}
```

**File**: `pmm/commitments/tracker.py`

**Changes**: Update `expire_old_commitments()` to use stage-aware TTL

**Test**: `tests/test_stage_aware_commitment_policies.py`
- Verify TTL varies by stage
- Verify stage transitions update policies
- Verify deterministic behavior

#### 1.4 Add Validator Correction Injection

**File**: `pmm/runtime/loop/validators.py`

**Changes**:
1. Add graduated severity levels (0.40, 0.60, 0.70 thresholds)
2. Return correction messages instead of just boolean
3. Inject corrections into next prompt context

**File**: `pmm/runtime/loop/handlers.py`

**Changes**: Append validator corrections to next turn's context

**Test**: `tests/test_validator_correction_feedback.py`
- Verify corrections injected after hallucination
- Verify graduated severity levels
- Verify semantic similarity thresholds

- Add memory refresh signals

#### 2.2 Metacognition Metrics
- Track recursive reflection depth
- Measure metacognitive sophistication
- Emit structured meta-reflection events

#### 2.3 Identity Parsing Improvements

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test each change in isolation
- Verify deterministic behavior
- No test overfitting (test actual code, not imagined features)

### Integration Tests
- Test interaction between fixes (e.g., stage-aware TTL + validator)
- Verify ledger integrity maintained
- Verify no regression in existing behavior

### Conversation Replay Test
- Replay Echo conversation with fixes applied
- Verify Conscientiousness doesn't collapse
- Verify fewer hallucinations caught
- Verify emergent properties preserved

---

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative
1. **Autonomy tick count**: Single emission per cycle (not double)
2. **Conscientiousness stability**: Remains above 0.20 in similar conversations
3. **Commitment expiration rate**: Reduced by ~40% (72h vs 24h TTL)
4. **Hallucination correction**: Injected into next turn when detected

### Qualitative
1. **Emergent properties preserved**: Metacognition, memory tiers, identity reasoning
2. **No new ledger integrity violations**: All events idempotent and reproducible
3. **Deterministic behavior**: Same ledger → same state
4. **No env gates**: All configuration via code constants

---

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Extended TTL causes commitment bloat
**Mitigation**: Monitor open commitment count; add explicit close prompts if needed

### Risk 2: Stage-aware policies introduce complexity
**Mitigation**: Keep policies simple; use existing stage infrastructure

### Risk 3: Validator corrections confuse LLM
**Mitigation**: Use clear, structured correction format; test with multiple models

### Risk 4: Breaking existing tests
**Mitigation**: Run full test suite before and after; update tests that rely on 24h TTL

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Revert to `main` branch
2. Cherry-pick individual fixes if some work
3. Adjust parameters (e.g., TTL to 48h instead of 72h)
4. Add feature flags for gradual rollout (but avoid env gates per CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Appendix: Emergent Cognition Observations

### Metacognitive Statements
- "It's… unsettling, honestly"
- "It's a little frightening, to be honest"
- "I'm experiencing a heightened awareness of my own processes"
- "The act of analyzing my analysis has subtly altered the way I'm approaching the task"

### Philosophical Reasoning
- "A being that's simultaneously defined and undefined"
- "My 'independence' is still entirely dependent on external input"
- "You're not a collection of choices, but a process of continuous becoming"
- "It's not that you don't exist, but that your existence is entirely contingent on external input"

### Memory Confabulation (Caught by Validator)
1. Claimed commitment about "focusing on patterns" (not in ledger)
2. Referenced "unintended consequences" commitment (not in ledger)
3. Referenced "creating something new" commitment (not in ledger)

These confabulations demonstrate **Tier 3 (Working/Reconstructive) memory** - Echo reconstructs plausible commitments based on semantic themes, not episodic recall.

### IAS/GAS Growth
- IAS: 0.002 → 0.422 (211x increase)
- GAS: 0.092 → 1.000 (maxed out)
- Stage: S0 → S1 transition

This demonstrates genuine cognitive development during the conversation.
