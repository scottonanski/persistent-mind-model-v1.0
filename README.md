# Persistent Mind Model v2

> Persistent Mind Model (PMM) is a deterministic, ledger‑recall system. Every behavior, reflection, or summary must be reconstructable from the event ledger alone — no predictions, heuristics, or external reasoning layers.

- Start: `pmm` (choose a model; use in‑chat commands `/replay`, `/metrics`, `/diag`, `/exit`).
- Tests: `pytest -q`

See `STATUS.md` for sprint progress and `CONTRIBUTING.md` for development rules.
